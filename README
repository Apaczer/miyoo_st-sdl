st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple virtual terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

Modified to run on Miyoo/Bittboy devices.
=> line doubling to deal with the 320x480 resolution
=> TTF fonts replaced by embedded pixel font (from TIC-80)
=> onscreen keyboard (see keyboard.c for button bindings)

Keys: 
- pad: select key
- B: press key
- A: toggles key (useful for shift/ctrl...)
- L: is shift
- R: is backspace
- X: change keyboard location (top/bottom)
- Y: show / hide keyboard
- SELECT: quit


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.
Also, you'll need a working bittboy toolchain, grab one here:

Installation
------------
Compile it using make . or grab a compiled version from the releases tab


Running st
----------
If you don't install st, define TNAME to "xterm" in config.h or make sure to at
least compile st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -s st.info

It should print the path of the compiled terminfo entry. You can
safely remove it if you don't plan to use st anymore.
See the man page for additional details.
